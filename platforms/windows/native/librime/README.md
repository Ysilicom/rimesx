# Pinned librime for Windows

CI and local Broker smokes fetch a **pinned official librime** instead of
hoping a Weasel install is already present.

The lock file is `librime-windows.lock.json`. Fetch with:

```powershell
../scripts/Fetch-RimesLibrime.ps1 -Architecture x64
```

The MSVC `rime.dll` statically includes **librime-lua** (Lua 5.4.8) and
**OpenCC**. The archive does **not** include OpenCC conversion tables; those
come from this repository's `rime-data/opencc` when a shared-data tree is
assembled. It also does not ship a separate `rime-lua.dll`.

The isolated CI schema under `testdata/e2e` is lua-free so typing tests do not
depend on the product `rime_ice` script tree. A later real install that wants
雾凇 still needs the RIMES `rime-data` lua modules next to the shared schemas.
